# smart_form
A modified variant package of *Form* widget in flutter as *SmartForm*, with freedom of using auto-validation feature only when formfield state is changed for at least once.
This form can be used to wrap any type of widget and use all the default features of the form on them. The package also modifies the textformfield and dropdownbuttonformfield for flexibility with auto-validation. 
Looking forward to add more features to the smart_form if required.
Suggestions will be appreciated.

*PS:* 
The code of the package uses most of the default flutter form widget code, with some changes, just for auto-validate to trigger only when the state of the FormField changes at least once. 
A couple of developers including me have already raised a PR for the same, to the official Flutter git repository. The flutter community is working on the required corrections for the same which may take sometime to merge, to stable or beta channel.
Till then you can make use of this package.
