name: smart_form
description: A modified variant of Form widget, with freedom of harnessing autovalidation feature only when form state is changed for the first time. This form can be used to wrap any type of widget and use all the additional features of the form on them. The package also modifies the textformfield and dropdownbuttonformfield for flexibility with autovalidation. Looking forward to add more features to the smart_form. Suggestions will be appreciated.

# To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg

#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see
# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

# https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

# To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
# fonts:
#   - family: Schyler
